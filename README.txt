We will probably want to start the game from com.RunAGame.java

- com.checkersgame.gui.CheckerBoard.java is the class that extends JFrame for the GUI
- com.checkersgame.gui.BoardUtility.java contains arrays of valid single moves and single jumps
- com.checkersgame.CheckersGame.java is the class that should validate Moves based on player and piece type
- com.agent is the package where we can put our bot, there is nothing in those classes yet
